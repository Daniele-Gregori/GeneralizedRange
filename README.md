# GeneralizedRange
***(Under construction)***

This paclet aims to provide various functions for systematically producing numbers with generic features: 

* members of rationals, algebraics, transcendentals or complexes;
* expressed in terms of constants, special functions or equations;
* constrained by bounds, steps or complexity.

Current functions hosted:

* FareyRange
* AlgebraicRange
* ComplexRange

All the functions provided can be particularly useful as options for the resource function [FindClosedForm](https://github.com/Daniele-Gregori/FindClosedForm), enabling it to exhaustively search generic closed forms in terms of arbitrary mathematical functions evaluated on the given ranges.
